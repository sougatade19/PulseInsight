# 📊 SentimentScope: Social Pulse Analytics

## 🔍 Project Overview

**SentimentScope** is a sentiment analysis and data visualization project designed to understand public opinion and emotional tone toward specific topics or brands using social media data (e.g., Twitter, Reddit). The project leverages NLP techniques to process user-generated content and reveals trends, moods, and insights that can influence marketing, public relations, or policy decisions.

## 📁 Dataset

We use publicly available datasets or APIs such as:

- [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/)
- [Kaggle - Sentiment140 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)
- [Reddit Scraped Data](https://www.pushshift.io/)
  
**Sample Columns:**
- `tweet_id`
- `user`
- `timestamp`
- `text`
- `likes`
- `retweets`
- `location` (optional)
- `sentiment_label` (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

## 🧠 Techniques & Tools

- **Data Cleaning**: NLTK, TextBlob, regex, stopword removal, tokenization
- **Sentiment Analysis**: 
  - TextBlob or VADER for rule-based sentiment
  - Fine-tuned BERT for deep learning-based sentiment classification (optional)
- **Visualization**: 
  - Word Clouds
  - Time Series Sentiment Trends
  - Geo-mapping (if location data available)
  - Pie Charts / Bar Graphs for sentiment distribution

## 📈 Sample Visualizations
